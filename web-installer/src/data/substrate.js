      chain. Firstly, you will enter the unique identifier of this chain. 
      The unique identifier is the name of the chain the nodes to be monitored 
      belong to. It should infer the types of nodes you will be 
      monitoring. If you are going to be monitoring Polkadot nodes 
      then the identifier should be Polkadot and you shouldn't 
      add nodes which do not belong to the Polkadot blockchain. For 
      example, do not setup Moonbeam nodes under the Polkadot chain 
      but setup a chain for Moonbeam and a chain for Polkadot, and 
      add respective nodes underneath them.`,
